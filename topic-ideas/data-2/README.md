# data

Data is being continuously collected and added to the dataset after reviewing chocolate bars - this can be seen as the first review years for chocolate bars began in 2006 and have continued until 2021.

The data is collected by members of the Manhattan Chocolate Society reviewing chocolate bars using the rating system found at <http://flavorsofcacao.com/review_guide.html> and adding other characteristics about the bar itself.
