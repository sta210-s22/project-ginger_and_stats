# Project idea 1

## Introduction and data

-   State the source of the data set.

    -   The source of the dataset is from the Board Game Geek website through the tidy tuesday package. A larger dataset can be found on Kaggle.

-   Describe when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data)

    -   The data was collected through crowd-sourced ratings posted on the Board Game Geek website over the span of various years, but for our analysis we will only focus on ratings during the year 2016.Â 

-   Describe the observations and the general characteristics being measured in the data

    -   The data is splitted into two datasets, one contains the technical information of the board games, and more details on the number of users owning them.

## Research question

-   Describe a research question you're interested in answering using this data.

## Glimpse of data

-   Use the `glimpse` function to provide an overview of the dataset

```{r warning = F, message = F}
#| label: data-1

details <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-01-25/details.csv')

ratings <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-01-25/ratings.csv')

glimpse(ratings)
glimpse(details)
```
